-- Since finalizers are executed in arbitrary threads, we must
-- ensure that we establish an autoreleasepool for the duration
-- of the execution of the release/dealloc messages.
-- Since the execution of each finalizer might get spread out
-- over several native threads, we perform the operation
-- together with pool allocation in c, to avoid allocating the
-- pool in one thread, executing the release/dealloc in a second
-- and freeing the pool in a third.
